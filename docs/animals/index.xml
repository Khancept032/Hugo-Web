      <description>Author: Caleb Williams Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera; with their forelimbs adapted as wings, they are the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight.
Bat Behavior There are many things about bats that make them unique, among them being:
 Bats are the second largest order of mammals, comprising about 20% of all classified mammal species.
 Bats are nocturnal (active at night).
 Most bats feed on insects, while others eat fruit, fish or even blood!</description>

      <description>Author: Nathan Taylor Cats are domesticated predators that went from dangerous hunters to wimpy and fat pets (by wimpy and fat I mean cool and suave). They are independent jerks that depend on us for their food (and we depend on them to defend us).
Cat Behavior Cats have some weird behaviors left over from them being actually good at hunting:
 Cats give humans their dead mice because they see us as part of their group and want to share their kills.</description>

      <description>Author: Eddie Alvarado Ferret Facts  The word ferret is from the Latin fur, meaning little thief. Indeed, one of the ferrets favorite activities is stealing and hiding things. Ferrets belong to the weasel (Mustelidae) family. Besides weasels and ferrets, this group of animals also includes minks, otters, and badgers as well as polecats and sables. An endangered species of ferrets previously thought to extinct, the black-footed ferret, was recently rediscovered in America.</description>
